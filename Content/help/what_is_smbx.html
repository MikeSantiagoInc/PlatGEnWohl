			<span style="font-weight: bold">History:</span></span><br><br>In the year 2009, Andrew "Redigit" 
			Spinks began work on game: <span style="text-decoration: underline">Super Mario Brothers X</span>. Gradually the 
			game gathered a following among fans of the Mario game series. <br>
			<center><img alt="" src="images/smbx_scr.png" height="225" width="300"></center><br>Perhaps, in my opinion, it is one of the best all time fan games 
			about Mario. In-game game-plays from games such as Super Mario Bros, 
			by Super Mario Brothers 2, SMB 3, Super Mario World, Legend of 
			Zelda, etc. are integrated. The built-in level editor allows not 
			only to edit levels, along with a engine to debug them in real time, 
			but also allows the player to create full-fledged episodes with a 
			plot!<br><br>Unfortunately in 2011, Redigit received a call from the 
			lawyers of Nintendo. Who threatened him, and demanded he remove SMBX 
			and stop any further development. After some time, the 
			supermariobrothers.org domain was also taken over by Nintendo. So 
			such a remarkable project was killed. <br><br>But even so, it has 
			still been played. A lot of "episodes" have been made for SMBX , and 
			the game is still in demand. Currently the game overloads the 
			processor to 100% even when the user is not in action.<br><br>There 
			were attempts to revive the project, but they failed.<br><br>The 
			main mistake - the <strong>game was published UNDER the UNTWISTED BRAND</strong>.<br>
			<center><img alt="" src="images/brand_theft.png" height="188" width="250"></center><br>
			And Redigit was making money off SMBX with distribution of ads in 
			installer, on forums and website. I.e. I parasitized on a brand. 
			Therefore Nintendo didn't like this and that's why SMBX was shut 
			down.<br><br>
			<span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="font-weight: bold">SMBX now:</span></span>
			<br><br>Now, SMBX still is in demand, on its 
			basis to these port episodes and levels, and even the whole games 
			are created.<br><br>
